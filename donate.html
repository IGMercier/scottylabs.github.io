          ScottyLabs powers innovation across the Carnegie Mellon campus, but we can't do it alone.

          API's@CMU. Learn more about our projects <a href="/">here</a>.

          Alternatively, you are welcome to donate to ScottyLabs directly using cash or a check (please
          make checks payable to Carnegie Mellon University, and write "ScottyLabs" in the note box),
          and give them to one of our team members.
