          ScottyLabs powers innovation across the Carnegie Mellon campus, but we can't do it alone.

        </p>
        <p style="margin:10px 0;">
	        Just follow these three steps:
	      </p>

          make checks payable to Carnegie Mellon University, and write "ScottyLabs" in the note box),
          and give them to one of our team members.

            If you're a company looking to connect with the CMU Students who make all of this
            possible, ScottyLabs is always looking for sponsors and partners to ensure that our
            events and projects remain excellent.  If your company might be interested in becoming a
            ScottyLabs partner, email us at 
            <a href="mailto:info@scottylabs.org">info@scottylabs.org</a> and we'd be happy to send
            you our sponsorship packet.
