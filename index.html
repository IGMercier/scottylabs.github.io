							<h3>TartanHacks 2013</h3>
							<p>TartanHacks is a hackathon designed for people who have great ideas for cool things. Last year, TartanHacks became the biggest hackathon on CMU’s campus (and the only student-run one). We had an awesome time last year (see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/anirudhkoul/sets/72157629419601487/">photos from last year</a> and read about <a href="http://2012.tartanhacks.com/the-tartanhacks-2012-winners/">last year's winning hacks</a></p>

							<p>Registration will open in the first week of the Spring 2013 semester. Leading up to the hackathon, we’ll be hosting student-led, skill-building talks. At the hackathon, we’ll have expert mentors, great food, and, well, fun. More details will be available at <a href="http://tartanhacks.com">tartanhacks.com</a> leading up to the hackathon.</p>

							<h3>Demo Day</h3>
							<p>Been working on a neat project in your free time? Want to see what other CMU students are working on in between classes? Join us for Demo Day - a place to show off your latest app or tech project. The only requirement is that you didn't make it for class.</p>
							<p>Presenters will each have 3 minutes to show off their project!</p>
							<p><em>Remember to be proud of your work, no matter how big or small.</em></p>

					<div class="project">
						<h2>APIS@CMU</h2>
						<h3>You need data about classes for your app?</br> We can hook you up.</h3>
						<p>ScottyLabs is creating APIs for student data at CMU, because scraping HTML and parsing PDFs is no fun.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="project">
						<h2>SkillSwap</h2>
						<h3>I'll teach you color theory if you teach me graph theory.</h3>
						<p>Come learn from other students at SkillSwap. There are workshops about everything from programming to pitching an idea. (Some workshops: Design Process, Pitching, What is a webapp?, API Design, HTML/CSS, iOS)</p>
						<p>This year, <a href="http://skillswap.scottylabs.org">SkillSwap Weekend was September 8th and 9th.</a> You can see summaries and get slides from the talks on the site.</p>
