          <h3>TartanHacks 2013</h3>
          <p>TartanHacks is a hackathon designed for people who have great ideas for cool things. Last year, TartanHacks became the biggest hackathon on CMU’s campus (and the only student-run one). We had an awesome time last year (see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/anirudhkoul/sets/72157629419601487/">photos from last year</a> and read about <a href="http://2012.tartanhacks.com/the-tartanhacks-2012-winners/">last year's winning hacks</a></p>

          <p>Registration will open in the first week of the Spring 2013 semester. Leading up to the hackathon, we’ll be hosting student-led, skill-building talks. At the hackathon, we’ll have expert mentors, great food, and, well, fun. More details will be available at <a href="http://tartanhacks.com">tartanhacks.com</a> leading up to the hackathon.</p>

            PDFs is no fun.
