        <h2>Our Mission</h2>

      <h3><em>We use our technical expertise to promote innovation in practical ways.</em></h3>
      <p>ScottyLabs is a student-run group on Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh campus. We strive to use our technical expertise to promote innovation in practical ways. For example, we are developing <a href="http://apis.scottylabs.org">APIs for educational data at Carnegie Mellon</a>, so that students can easily build applications using that data. In addition, we are working with schools across the country to create a nationwide standard for APIs for university data. In early 2012, we also founded and organized Carnegie Mellon’s largest hackathon, <a href="http://www.tartanhacks.com/">TartanHacks.</a></p>

        <h2>The Backstory</h2>
      </hgroup>
                <p>
                    In the summer of 2011, Vinay Vemuri showed Amy Quispe a side project that
                    had involved entering tons of data by hand. Amy proposed an idea: do the
                    hard work once. Together they launched the project that would become
                    <a href="http://apis.scottylabs.org">APIs@CMU</a>, an effort to compile all
                    of the university's publicly available data into a machine-readable format
                    and, with the cooperation of the administration, provide that data to
                    students and faculty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the course of the Fall 2011 semester, the project grew to include
                    more people and the group added more projects that fit our goal of
                    promoting innovation in practical ways. In November of 2011, we started
                    planning for the launch of the APIs@CMU project.  Vinay suggested that the
                    best way to encourage people to use the new API was to host a Hackathon,
                    and <a href="http://www.tartanhacks.com/" >TartanHacks</a> was born.
                    With two projects and a small group of dedicated members, we decided that
                    our group needed a name.  We chose ScottyLabs.
