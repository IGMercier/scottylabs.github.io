						<h2>Our Mission</h2>
					</hgroup>
					<h3><em>We use our technical expertise to promote innovation in practical ways.</em></h3>
					<p>ScottyLabs is a student-run group on Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh campus. We strive to use our technical expertise to promote innovation in practical ways. For example, we are developing <a href="http://apis.scottylabs.org">APIs for educational data at Carnegie Mellon</a>, so that students can easily build applications using that data. In addition, we are working with schools across the country to create a nationwide standard for APIs for university data. In early 2012, we also founded and organized Carnegie Mellon’s largest hackathon, <a href="http://www.tartanhacks.com/feature/about/">TartanHacks.</a></p>

						<h2> The Backstory</h2>
					</hgroup>
					<p>In the summer of 2011, Vinay Vemuri showed Amy Quispe a side project that had involved entering tons of data by hand. Amy proposed an idea: do the hard work once. Together they launched the project that would become <a href="http://apis.scottylabs.org">APIs@CMU</a>, an effort to compile all of the university's publicly available data into a machine-readable format and, with the cooperation of the administration, provide that data to students and faculty. </p><p>Over the course of the Fall 2011 semester, the project grew to include more people and the group added more projects that fit our goal of promoting innocation in practical ways. In November of 2011, we were big enough that we finally adopted our name and became ScottyLabs</p>
