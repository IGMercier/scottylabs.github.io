					<h2>APIs@CMU</h2>
					<h3>You need the school bookstore data for your app? We can hook you up.</h3>
					<p>ScottyLabs's flagship project, APIs@CMU gives student and faculty developers access to university data like the student directory and schedule of classes in an easily-parseable JSON format.  The APIs@CMU project is planned to launch in the Fall 2012 semester. Visit <a href="apis.scottylabs.org">apis.scottylabs.org</a> for more information and to see documentation for the APIs.

					<h2>TartanHacks</h2>
					<h3>Twenty-four hours to make something awesome.</h3>
					<p>A hackathon is an event where a bunch of people get together in teams for a fixed amount of time to make something cool.  Prizes, pizza, and caffeine are usually involved. TartanHacks is a hackathon designed for people who have great ideas for cool things, but might not yet have the skills to make them into a reality.  We provide seminars on web and mobile development, expert mentors available for the full 24 hours, and food that's way better than pizza. TartanHacks happens each year at the beginning of the spring semester; go to<a href="tartanhacks.com">tartanhacks.com </a> for more information.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Demo Days</h2>
					<p>CMU students do a lot of really cool things in clubs, or just in their free time, but we rarely get a chance to show off. Come to our Demo Days— twice each semester— to show off what you've done or to see what your fellow students have done. All kinds of projects are welcome, not just technical ones! </p>

					<h2>SkillSwap</h2>
					<h3>I'll teach you color theory if you teach me graph theory.</h3>
