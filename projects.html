						<h2>TartanHacks</h2>
						<h3>Twenty-four hours to make something awesome.</h3>
					</hgroup>
					<p>A hackathon is an event where a bunch of people get together in teams for a fixed amount of time to make something cool.  Prizes, pizza, and caffeine are usually involved. TartanHacks is a hackathon designed for people who have great ideas for cool things. At TartanHacks, ScottyLabs will help you turn your idea into reality.</p><p> We provide seminars on web and mobile development, expert mentors available for the full 24 hours, and food that's way better than pizza. TartanHacks happens each year at the beginning of the spring semester; go to <a href="tartanhacks.com">tartanhacks.com </a> for more information.</p>

						<h2>Demo Days</h2>
						<h3>It's time to show off.</h3>
					</hgroup>
					<p>CMU students do a lot of really cool things in clubs, or just in their free time, but we rarely get a chance to show off. Come to our Demo Days— twice each semester— to show off what you've done or to see what your fellow students have done. All kinds of projects are welcome, not just technical ones! </p>

						<h2>SkillSwap</h2>
						<h3>I'll teach you color theory if you teach me graph theory.</h3>
					</hgroup>
					<p>SkillSwap Weekend is a two day event during which expert student volunteers will teach other students new skills. There are workshops about everything from programming to pitching an idea. Our workshops are targeted at different skill levels, so that any student can find something to learn.</p>
