				<h2>TartanHacks</h2>
				<h3>Twenty-four hours to make something awesome.</h3>
			</hgroup>
            <p>
                A hackathon is an event where a bunch of people get together in teams for a fixed
                amount of time to make something cool.  Prizes, pizza, and caffeine are usually
                involved. TartanHacks is a hackathon designed for people who have great ideas for cool
                things. At TartanHacks, ScottyLabs will help you turn your idea into reality.</p><p> We
                provide seminars on web and mobile development, expert mentors available for the full 24
                hours, and food that's way better than pizza. TartanHacks happens each year at the
                beginning of the spring semester; go to
                <a href="http://www.tartanhacks.com">tartanhacks.com</a> for more information.

				<h2>Make CMU</h2>
				<h3>Cool projects with cool people.</h3>
			</hgroup>
            <p>
                <a href="http://www.makecmu.com/" >Make CMU</a> was founded in 2012 as a space for
                artists, designers, hackers, and anyone else who like to make things to meet up once
                a week and work on whatever struck their fancy.  In the Spring of 2013, Make CMU
                merged with ScottyLabs, and we now run the weekly hackerspace. Come join us on
                Saturdays from 2pm - 5pm in the Studio for Creative Inquiry in the CFA building.

				<h2>Print @ ScottyLabs</h2>
				<h3>Easy mobile printing for Carnegie Mellon.</h3>
			</hgroup>
            <p>
                <a href="http://print.scottylabs.org/">Print@ScottyLabs</a> was started as a pet
                project to see if it was possible to print documents by sending them to an email
                address.  Not only is it possible, it also turned out to be incredibly useful for
                busy CMU students on the go.  Send an email to 
                <a href="mailto:print@scottylabs.org">print@scottylabs.org</a> from your andrew
                account to get started.

				<h2>Demo Days</h2>
				<h3>It's time to show off.</h3>
			</hgroup>
            <p>
                CMU students do a lot of really cool things in clubs, or just in their free time, but
                we rarely get a chance to show off. Come to our Demo Days— twice each semester—
                to show off what you've done or to see what your fellow students have done. All kinds of
                projects are welcome, not just technical ones!

				<h2>SkillSwap</h2>
				<h3>I'll teach you color theory if you teach me graph theory.</h3>
			</hgroup>
			<p>
                SkillSwap Weekend is a two day event during which expert student volunteers will
                teach other students new skills. There are workshops about everything from programming
                to pitching an idea. Our workshops are targeted at different skill levels, so that any
                student can find something to learn.
            </p>
            <p>
                SkillSwap 2012 happened last september and was a smashing success. You can find out
                more about the event at its <a href="http://skillswap.scottylabs.org/">website</a>.

                On November 1st 2012, ScottyLabs and Project Olympus took 25 students on a tour of
                several of the startups in Pittsburgh. Starting at Project Olympus on Craig St, students
                made their way to AlphaLabs, Schell Games, 4Moms. The day ended with dinner with Luis
                von Ahn at DuoLingo. Through presentations, Q&amp;A panels, and building tours,
                participants received a glimpse of life at a startup. It introduced them to the
                challenges and benefits of working at one. In addition, students received valuable
                advice about how to start their own. We hope that next time we can make it bigger and
                better!
